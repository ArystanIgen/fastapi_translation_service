## Known Flaws
- The current setup does not include redundancy for the MongoDB database, making it a single point of failure.
- The `GetWordDetails` API does not allow users to choose source and destination languages for translations.
- The `translate_api`, written in NodeJS, occasionally fails to receive proper requests from Google Translate.
- The application may face scalability issues under high load as it relies on a single instance of MongoDB.

## Possible Improvements
- Develop a custom parser in Python instead of relying on the NodeJS package and backend to enhance reliability and integration.
- Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application performance and health
- Add additional query parameters for `GetWordDetails` to allow users to specify source and destination languages.
- Implement a replica set for MongoDB to ensure high availability and data redundancy.
